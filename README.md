## FAQ

* **Is there a detailed guide on how to use this?**
  * Yes, [here](guide/detailed.md)
* **I am having a lot of `BAD FILE` failures while installing mods.**
  * The **`BAD FILE`** error usually happens because the downloaded file is corrupt or empty. This can be fixed by changing the method of installation to `SMODS`. Go through the [guide](guide/detailed.md) on how to do it.
* **Some of the items keep failing repeatedly with `[!]` symbol, and the script doesn't end.**
  * This is a known bug, which will be fixed later. For now, if the script seems to be stuck in a loop, giving `[!]` symbol for the same item repeatedly, use `ctrl + c` to terminate the script.
* **Which terminal are you using?**
  * I'm using [Hyper](https://hyper.is/), with zsh.
